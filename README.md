 Project contents: 
 1. Top10 Python notebook analyzing what the top 10 causes of complaint calls to 311 are at 11235 ZIP code.
 2. Parking Python notebook analyzing whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total 311 incidents at 11235 ZIP code than they are in general in the global dataset.

 Description of what has been implemented - use of pandas package to read csv file and retrive required output for the analysis. For the Top10.ipynb pandas was used to retrive the chronological set of top 10 complaint types that had the highest values in a local dataset of chosen ZIP code (11325). For the Parking.ipynb, pandas package was used to retrive two datapoints of illegal parking within local boundaries and global boundaries to return a boolean statement whether the local incidents of illegal parking were of higher proportion than the global incidents. True if yes, False if not.
