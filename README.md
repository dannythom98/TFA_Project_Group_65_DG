 Project contents: 
 1. Top10 Python notebook analyzing what the top 10 causes of calls to 311 are at 11235 ZIP code.
 2. Parking Python notebook analyzing whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total 311 incidents at 11235 ZIP code than they are in general in the global dataset.

 Description of what has been implemented - use of pandas package to read csv file and retrive required output for the analysis. For the Top10.ipynb pandas was used to retrive the chronological set of complain types that had the highest values in a dataset. For the Parking.ipynb, pandas package was used to retrive two datapoints of illigal parking within local boundaries and global boundaries to return a boolean statement wether the local incidents were higher than the global incidents. True if yes, False if not.
